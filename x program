'''
Explenation:
You're looping through all the rows in the outer loop, then all the columns or cells in the inner. 
Then if clause checks whether you're on a diagonal.
The comma after the print statement ensures you don't get a new line every print. 
The 3rd print gives you a new line once you're finished with that row.
